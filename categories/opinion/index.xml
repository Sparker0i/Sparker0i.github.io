From seeing multiple bull-runs, to governments trying to destroy the movement of sovereign independence, to countries adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender, cryptocurrencies have come a long way. I have been holding crypto-currencies since 2019, but it was only at the start of this year that I actually started trading and buying them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, if you ask anyone online about which crypto to buy, you will be frequently met with the term #DYOR - Do Your Own Research. Same was with me as well, whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve asked people on tips, I was told to #DYOR, but there were not many tips online about what to do in DYOR. Like many in the beginning, I&amp;rsquo;ve had my shares of success and failures in crypto hodling and trading. Here are a few tips I follow when looking to buy tokens.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="initial-research-and-filtering-bad-assets">Initial Research and Filtering Bad Assets
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Before I hodl or trade any tokens, I make sure to do some initial research with a few pointers. I&amp;rsquo;d feel great about those tokens that meet this initial criteria, while others become a big no-go for the rest of my life (unless something drastically changes in that particular crypto&amp;rsquo;s tech, but would be unlikely).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I do is visit CoinMarketCap website, search for the particular crypto I&amp;rsquo;m looking to hodl or invest. Every major crypto asset listed on CoinMarketCap will have its own website, and that is the first thing I always look at. Within the website, the first thing you should read is the &lt;strong>Whitepaper&lt;/strong> of the token. When you read through the various pages on a particular crypto&amp;rsquo;s website, I am able to mostly detect any non-sense or BS. If it uses any terms or protocols that you find it hard to comprehend - like it &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>promises&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; a huge payout or claims to have some tech that seems to good to be true (like self-mining) - immediately avoid it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should also look for some more things like Roadmap of features for the particular project and the track record on how it has delivered so far on all those features. If a project has consistently failed or lagged behind to deliver new features, you should treat it as another yellow flag. I&amp;rsquo;d also look at how the crypto&amp;rsquo;s tech functions and the value a token is trying to create. If there are no unique use-cases or if the crypto does not require/benefit from the use of blockchain fundamentals, I&amp;rsquo;d give it a red flag and move on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that you should really look at is the Blockchain Explorer for a given crypto. First thing I&amp;rsquo;d check here is the max supply for the given crypto. Needless to say, stablecoins are a no-go here. If there&amp;rsquo;s no max supply for a token, it is usually a Red Flag from my side, although there are a very few exceptions for this - like Ethereum. If you still want to go ahead and deal with cryptos without a max supply, you should do it at your own risk and must usually look to own it only for the short-term and not hodl them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next thing you should look at is the distribution of tokens across all wallet holders of the given token. If you see that one wallet holds more than 15-20% of the total current supply, I&amp;rsquo;d raise a red flag here. The moment a big whale dumps (sells) all those coins, the entire crypto will start reeling. Best example would be Vitalik Buterin &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-destroys-410-trillion-shiba-inu-coins/VCNH2FDFQYRVDD6U3Q6VFYZ2XQ/?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dumping 45% of the entire Shiba Inu coins in supply&lt;/a>, causing a massive drop in the price of the Shiba Inu coin. (More surprising in the case of Shiba Inu is that the Whitepaper of the coin still refers Buterin as a visionary - &amp;ldquo;like its anonymous founder&amp;rdquo; - even after he dumped the project&amp;rsquo;s worth)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some other pointers that you can consider to research would be browsing the source code of a given asset on GitHub and the amount of activity in its repos in the recent past. As an alternate means, try going through the blogs and subreddit of the given token and look for any threads that look skeptical to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="avoid-scams">Avoid Scams
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When you start off dealing with cryptos, you would be looking at ways to maximize money instantly. While I&amp;rsquo;d say it is not impossible, but I would advise you to not do that. Lured by the opportunity of making quick money, people might fall into the trap of crypto scams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of these scams happen on Telegram within groups which usually advertise quick money making schemes in the form of Token Airdrops. They will mostly look to lure you with &amp;ldquo;verified&amp;rdquo; token deposit screenshots from customers. These &amp;ldquo;customers&amp;rdquo; are either running the scam along with the admins of the group, or are accounts managed by the admins themselves. If you look to participate in such airdrops, you will end up losing all your life savings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying all airdrops are bad. Some of them that have happened - like the Stellar Airdrops in 2017 and 2019. But that was done by a verified entity - the Stellar Foundation. Here we are talking about Telegram groups that are run by Anonymous Users. Such groups are always Bait and Scam, and I would recommend you to avoid them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fill-out-an-investment-checklist">Fill out an Investment Checklist
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once I&amp;rsquo;m done filtering out the coins I invest in, I look to create an investment checklist where I have noted certain questions that I ask before I invest in a coin. Here are the details of the questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is the problem that a crypto is trying to solve?&lt;/strong> Like I mentioned in the previous section, if a token does not serve a purpose or does not solve a problem - not just with blockchains or the financial sector, but any sector, say Education or Supply Chain - I believe there is no reason for that coin to exist. Such coins are only hype driven and only good for short-term trading. I will call such hype-driven coins as &lt;strong>Shitcoins&lt;/strong> from now. Hodling them for a long term will leave you reeling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?&lt;/strong> I will look for is the history of some of the Lead members on a project and see what they have worked on previously - via information they post online (say on LinkedIn). If they are anonymous members (exception: Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin), I&amp;rsquo;ll automatically raise a Red flag on that crypto and move on. Then, I will also look at how they are funded. Whether they have partnerships with Enterprises or they have solved a critical problem for any pillar of the society - say government or law - or any other major piece of news regarding any advancement that was made possible because of a crypto.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who is their competition and how big is the market they&amp;rsquo;re targeting?&lt;/strong> What is the roadmap they created? Like I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in the previous section, you should always have a look at the roadmap for a given token. No roadmap -&amp;gt; No progress -&amp;gt; Red Flag. Also you need to look at the other coins being offered in the market and how do they compete with the token you&amp;rsquo;re looking to buy. Because healthy competition always leads to success, unless you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a shitcoin, or the competitors of a given token are all shitcoins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?&lt;/strong> There are cryptos which rely on various types of consensus mechanisms - Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Time and Space etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?&lt;/strong> Of course there can never be some shortcoming associated with a given crypto. If there are none, it sounds too good to be true. (Even for Bitcoin, there&amp;rsquo;s only one disadvantage that I can think about - Electricity consumption. But that too is definitely lesser than electricity used for mining actual Gold, or by the entire banking system around the world)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-valuation-framework-for-a-token">Create a Valuation Framework for a token
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With the boom that crypto trading has seen since November 2020, you must always be sure of what coins you want to invest in. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of various crypto groups on multiple sites like Facebook and Reddit. In it, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of people complain about the losses they&amp;rsquo;ve had to made while dealing with crypto, because they either bought high and then the market went bearish, or they invested in the pump-and-dump shitcoins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To avoid becoming one among such people, you need to have a certain valuation model for a given crypto. Even if you create a basic one, you&amp;rsquo;ll go miles ahead of your peers/other people. Here are some simple things you can consider doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Look at the total market cap of the coin and compare it with the size of the market it is trying to address. Market cap here includes not only the circulating supply, but also the max supply possible for the crypto.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check for the total number of users of a given token. I believe that the value of a given crypto would be proportional to the number of users using the crypto. The best known crypto out there is Bitcoin and there are almost 100 Million people already using it. Compounded with its scarcity, its scale and community is why Bitcoin carries a huge value.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These were 2 very basic checks that I do for any crypto. I might add some other checks in the evaluation framework as well. Once you have a model setup, you can then evaluate one crypto against another, and also see why you would want to own this coin rather than do short-term trading. Doing this will lead you to think long term about dealing with a given crypto and think more about the &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; it provides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you do this, you will have more mental peace and have good confidence for your decision making. You would also not panic when there are any short-term price dips.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="portfolio-allocation">Portfolio Allocation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is one of the crucial aspects of your journey with crypto. You should think on how much fiat you can use to buy crypto, as well as how do you want to allocate your crypto portfolio between &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rigged&amp;rdquo; cryptos. (planned pump-and-dump, shitcoins etc.). If you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out, I would recommend you to not go with shitcoins to begin with. I have seen a few of my friends who started their crypto journeys because of celebrities who rig coins like Elon Musk and co. The peak of this came during Elon&amp;rsquo;s SNL appearance. Despite my advice against it, most of my friends bought Dogecoin only because of Elon&amp;rsquo;s appearance and thinking it&amp;rsquo;s price will keep going up if they bought then. Little did they know that it was the starting point for dumping Dogecoin, whose effects can still be felt today. Many of my friends felt cheated, and some of them have left the crypto space despite my assurances that not all cryptos are bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend having 80-90% of your portfolio filled with safe coins. Once you become more informed and confident, you can start dealing with Shitcoins and vary your portfolio allocation. You should also think in terms of crypto categories as well as the percentage of your portfolio in each of these segments. For starters, I categorise crypto into following categories: (You may disagree with how I&amp;rsquo;m grouping the cryptos, but we can agree to disagree)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Core Holdings: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smart Contracts: Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), ALGO, Solana etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Crypto with Privacy?: Monero (XMR), ZCash&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intermediary with fiat dealings/Bank Settlement: Stellar (XLM), Ripple (XRP)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enterprise Solutions: VeChain etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Promising: NANO, IOTA, RVN, Algo etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coins without intrinsic value (Shitcoin): DOGE + the army of dog coins (Shiba, Kishu) etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You should also have a fair idea about the market conditions as there is a lot of uncertainty today, mostly due to policies+governments and others due to rigging shitcoins. Due to this uncertainty, you should best stick to the core holdings and then pick up coins in segments you are knowledgeable enough about. Example, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know about Smart Contracts, how can you be sure that ALGO is a game changer?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where portfolio diversification and allocation comes into place. You should look to diversify, but in the ever-changing world of crypto you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t look to diversify way too much. It would be difficult for you to keep up with all the changes that have occurred across cryptos. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend you to have more than 10-12 cryptos. If you have more, I would recommend you to consolidate to the few segments you are well knowledgeable about.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="learn-everyday">Learn Everyday
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t doing this already, read a bit daily on cryptocurrencies. There are decent YouTubers that talk about the market movements in the crypto space. You should also learn more about the underlying principles in the crypto space. More specifically, if you are not aware of basics like Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Space (PoS), learn about it first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you invest in stocks, one factor you would look for is what are the core offerings of a given company and how it performs against other peers. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about how the underlying technology of a crypto works, learn about it as well. That will increase your belief if you want to buy that crypto. If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the underlying technology or find reading about it very tedious, I believe you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in this crypto space at all and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t look to invest here, otherwise you will feel betrayed after your coins&amp;rsquo; value gets dumped.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is the state of targeted digital advertising broken?</title><link>https://blog.sparker0i.me/health-targeted-digital-advertising-today/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 03:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sparker0i.me/health-targeted-digital-advertising-today/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/health-targeted-digital-advertising-today/661c080c8442574e70467574.png" alt="Featured image of post Is the state of targeted digital advertising broken?" />&lt;p>Advertisements are everywhere - You see ads on your newspaper, your family sees ads on TV channels, there are ads on billboards seen by people in and around an area, and you too see ads on almost any website you visit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, internet advertising industry is broken. It&amp;rsquo;s failing the users and the advertisers themselves. Internet advertising majorly uses targeted/personalized ads to go after you and cater products you would most likely want. This ends up collecting as much data about you as it can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post, I will argue why the current model of internet advertising is bad, and how can you save yourself from being a victim of personalized ad targeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-regular-users-perspective-on-advertising">A Regular User&amp;rsquo;s Perspective on Advertising
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If you ask me what are the problems with the current model of advertising online, here are a few things I might suggest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ads violate privacy: There&amp;rsquo;s no secret to this, internet advertising scoops up as much information about you from the services you visit and use.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ads are disruptive: As an example, sometimes you click on a blank area in a website, you then see a new pop-up window with an ad, despite your browser blocking pop-ups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ads are annoying: Sometimes you visit an interesting website, and the very next moment when you open a social media website, you start seeing ads about this almost everytime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Malicious Ads: A vast majority of the people of my generation shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be worried about Malicious ads, as our generation is aware about websites and malware, and we&amp;rsquo;d only visit website after due diligence. But our previous generations are not so well-informed about websites, they would click on any website and that site may end up spreading malware.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What I&amp;rsquo;m worried about is the first point - Digital Advertising violating our privacy. While our previous generations are not much aware about their Data Privacy, our current generation does worry about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we sit here, worrying about our privacy, IMF has &amp;ldquo;suggested&amp;rdquo; that a person&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://gizmodo.com/your-credit-score-should-be-based-on-your-web-history-1845912592?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>credit history should be based on their Web History&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s how ridiculous things may get in the future if things are not corrected today. A 2018 study by researchers at Data and Society &lt;a class="link" href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DS_Digital_Influence_Machine.pdf?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>concluded&lt;/a> that “today’s digital advertising infrastructure creates disturbing new opportunities for political manipulation and other forms of antidemocratic strategic communication.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even without concerns of privacy violations, there have been many efforts to try and fix some of the issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.betterads.org/?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Coalition for Better Ads&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://acceptableads.com/?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Acceptable Ads&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brave&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These only fix some of the problems with Advertising in general, not the entire problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Multiple advertisements craving for your attention&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://medium.com/rsa-journal/democracy-distracted-cf3272ceb3c4?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Herbert Simon argued in the 70s&lt;/a> that when information becomes abundant, attention becomes the scarce resource. In today&amp;rsquo;s modern age, we’re living through the pendulum swing of that reversal—yet we consistently overlook its implications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you visit any website or browse through any app, you take some time out of your life - or your &lt;strong>attention&lt;/strong> to visit that resource. You are also using some of your attention to read this post (for which I&amp;rsquo;m eternally grateful). Now, you normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take out some of this attention to visit a website that you haven&amp;rsquo;t clicked by yourself. Thus, such websites/apps allow to advertise within itself (mostly as a small banner) via publishers, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to take out extra time off your life just to visit the standalone ad. Then, such publishers use your &amp;ldquo;actions&amp;rdquo;, and use such individualized data about you - collected via algorithms - and sell slots to advertisers to display ads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wikipedia has a perfect definition for this - &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Attention Economy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t love to have an individualized feed of news. Sadly, individualization that happens today is neither for our own benefit nor for getting a peace of mind. Rather such a system only invites more outrage from us - users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, an incentive driven advertising system is good for the publishers, who earn good money; and advertisers, who get to sell lot more of their products. But this is bad for the user. There are literally billions of dollars being spent to figure out how to persuade you to look at a certain thing over a competitor&amp;rsquo;s; to care about one thing over another. This is the way most of the information in this world is being monetized today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can all see the effects of Attention Economy - Social Media websites like Twitter and Facebook never want people of different groups to stop fighting - be it over religion, sports or their political bias. This is because these networks are optimized in a way to promote fighting, or spread fake news/propaganda very quickly. You may argue that companies are investing to stop fake news, but I believe that it is still relatively minor as they don&amp;rsquo;t really want their revenue streams to go down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-take-on-digital-ads">My take on digital ads
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I don’t want any relevant ads, or any ad-driven products, ever. Other people might feel differently, but collecting the data is only half the problem. That data can be abused, even if only client-side - for example targeting could exploit you and persuade to buy stuff you don’t need. The whole point of ads is to change your behavior, if only slightly, with advertisers literally bidding for your attention, and then playing mind tricks, which work because of how our critical thinking often fails us a majority of the times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe great products have often been successful via word of mouth referrals. A great example would be &lt;strong>Cred&lt;/strong>. Only a few credit card users in India were aware of the Cred before September 2020. That month, a delayed IPL 2020 started, and Cred ads - which a majority of the Indians never understood - was everywhere on TV, getting people&amp;rsquo;s interest in knowing about the product, and eventually end up using it. There are tactics that don’t involve tricking people into changing their behavior. Conventional advertising is better than the targeted ones, because it’s not individualized. At least everybody else is seeing the same shit that you’re seeing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That brings us to the most important question - What should companies do? Honestly speaking, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s our problem. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any company should be entitled to our data or our attention. When was the last time you ever saw an ad that made you feel this is the real deal. I haven&amp;rsquo;t, have you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know how the unethical behavior of companies is always excused via the requirement of company stakeholders to make money? Well, this goes both ways. We, the consumers, aren’t running any charity. I strongly feel it isn’t our job to save such dying business models.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="first-party-ads">First Party Ads
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One solution to the problem could be the content providers (websites/apps) serving ads based on content that is being viewed right now. This might ensure there is no need to keep user&amp;rsquo;s profile and history. Your data will no longer be shared to third-parties and hence the quality of ads shown will get better - which also means no scam ads and no malvertising.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This too has a problem. Even if there is a whitelist for “acceptable ads”, the problem is those ads are still downloaded Javascript code, with no way to review what they do. Further, third-party requests could get disguised as first-party ones. In such cases, you have to trust the publishers, which I&amp;rsquo;d usually find a hard time to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="then-wouldnt-ad-blocking-affect-the-internet">Then, Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t Ad-Blocking affect the Internet?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Given a choice between receiving ads, and no ads, sane people would obviously choose no ads. Nobody likes ads. If its forced, we have to gulp it down our throat, because either there&amp;rsquo;s no clear alternative (Facebook), or the price of no-ads option is way too high (Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, Hotstar et al.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost no browser ships with an aggressive ad-blocker enabled by default. This is because somewhere or the other, their business model is also dependent on ads, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t serve ads directly. It will only make the end user&amp;rsquo;s experience much better. Many browsers that claim to do aggressive ad-blocking like Microsoft Edge, Brave, Samsung, Vivaldi et al. earn a lot of money from advertising.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ad-blocking affect the Internet&amp;rsquo;s health? Yes, it will. Negatively, on the advertisers and publishers&amp;rsquo; wallets; Positively on the rest of the internet, because it can only get better from there on.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I really enjoy something, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind paying for it. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;strong>Hey email&lt;/strong> since July. It did not catch my attention because of all the amazing features it brings, but rather because of its infamous &lt;a class="link" href="https://hey.com/apple/?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it so far without any major problems. All advertising mails are now screened out, so that they never take my attention again. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed emails for all my online accounts to reflect to my hey.com email address. Now there are certain services like stock and mutual fund brokers, whose email change process has to be offline. Once all of my services are moved over to Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m deleting all my non Hey mail accounts (except primary Google Play Store and Microsoft Store accounts, because all my app/in-app purchase history is sitting in those 2 accounts).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, I&amp;rsquo;m also using &lt;strong>Spotify Premium&lt;/strong> because I don&amp;rsquo;t want myself to be exposed to their ads right after one song.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also pay for &lt;strong>Xbox Game Pass for PC&lt;/strong>. It has more than 100 AAA PC games that I can easily play on my Lenovo Legion Y740 laptop. There are no ads in the games that are played via XGP. I regularly play Age of Empires 2: DE, Flight Simulator, Doom Eternal, Moto GP20 and The Outer Worlds. Buying all those games individually would&amp;rsquo;ve cost me a fortune, but at Rs 489/month (577 if you include taxes) it is a killer deal, specially for gamers like me. I am also using &lt;strong>Kindle Unlimited&lt;/strong> for Reading as many Books as I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all the information I&amp;rsquo;m unearthing every single day about the shady practices of all developers, I&amp;rsquo;m removing all ads-enabled apps from my mobiles. Moreover, if I find that any app is sharing data that is unwanted, I promptly uninstall that app. If at all I really need to use the app&amp;rsquo;s services which provide ads, I would find a browser-based alternative for it - Eg. Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, IG, Amazon + Entertainment apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="block-all-ads">Block All Ads
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Even if you may think that some ads are fine, but do you know whether those are targeted specifically to you or not? Even if there&amp;rsquo;s a whitelist of &amp;ldquo;acceptable ads&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s still Javascript code downloaded from the internet, which I have no idea about its functionality. It&amp;rsquo;s still intrusive, and drives you to buy things you don&amp;rsquo;t really want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really think it is wrong that Publishers think they can run code on our devices. If publishers think otherwise, they can feel free to block me from using their services. If I see any website that serves me ads (and gets caught by my ad blockers), I&amp;rsquo;d really start looking for alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="blocking-for-all-devices">Blocking for all devices
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>DNS blocking has worked well so far. That is until apps/sites starting using DNS-over-HTTPS over their own servers. Still there are techniques to circumvent this too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PiHole&lt;/strong>: I had a Raspberry Pi 3B sitting idle at home for the last 1 year or so. When I got to know that I could run a service like Pihole on it, I wasted no time to set it up. Ever since Christmas eve, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Pihole to block ads for all the devices my family uses. And the stats are great too:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pihole stats since December 23, 2020&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though the only downside to this is that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to change my router to use static IP address assignment. There was some initial hassle in setting up my router and the devices, but once that was done, ads were a thing of the past (except Youtube ads, for which there is no working solution in 2021. Screw you, Google).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hosted services&lt;/strong>: 3 months before trying out Pihole, I tried using NextDNS. While the results were incredible, I felt that giving away Rs. 159 every month (187 including taxes) was a bit too much for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard about Adguard DNS, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it so far.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;h3 id="desktoplaptop--android-devices">Desktop/Laptop + Android devices
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Even before I&amp;rsquo;ve been using PiHole, I had experimented with ad blocking via browser extensions. The best combination I&amp;rsquo;ve found is Firefox + uBlock Origin + Privacy Badger. It simply works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>uBlock Origin is by far the best ad blocker I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used. Ever since installing it, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed far better loading speeds, because there are lesser resources to be loaded. It also protects against CNAME cloaking, where 3rd party requests masquerade as 1st party ones and you might not even notice it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly, this won&amp;rsquo;t work with Google Chrome and other Chromium forked browsers in the near future. This is because Manifest v3 for Chrome extensions will be deployed in Google Chrome sometime in January (with the release of v88). Simply put, Manifest is something any extension developer will have to follow while developing an extension. This particular Manifest v3 changes the way ad-blocking extensions function. This negatively impacts ad-blockers and uBlock is one of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My take on this will be to ditch Chrome/Chromium forked browsers ASAP. Switch to Firefox while you still can, because Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s financials aren&amp;rsquo;t great, and the browser could go kaput anytime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same combination also works well for Android as well, just that you will have to update the Firefox browser to whichever latest version is available.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Brave browser displaying ads from Brave Network via OS notifications&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brave is yet another Chromium fork which focuses on user privacy by blocking trackers, scripts and ads by default. So inside some pages where ads don&amp;rsquo;t load properly, you might be forced to turn down Brave Shields, which will then open up the website to show you ads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time you&amp;rsquo;ve reached here, you must&amp;rsquo;ve realised that internet is up and running, all thanks to advertisements. The content you might be seeing for free is able to remain free because of advertising. This is profitable for both advertisers and publishers, but not the users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brave attempts to change the advertising model by flipping the pyramid upside down. What I mean is, users get paid for getting advertisements on their devices. It allows users to opt-in to its own Brave rewards system (in other words, another advertising system). Brave serves ads after blocking ads from third party providers on websites, and then start showing ads from their own advertising platform via OS level notifications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve opted-in, Brave will display you &amp;lsquo;privacy-respecting&amp;rsquo; ads (it&amp;rsquo;s still an advertisement btw 😂) and if you receive an ad, you will be rewarded with a BAT cryptocurrency (BAT = Basic Attention Token), which you can use to support Brave verified creators (You can&amp;rsquo;t withdraw those tokens to your crypto wallet yet, that&amp;rsquo;s coming soon though).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brave intends to serve ads as per user interests, in an anonymised way. This could be either via client-side profiling, or simply piggybacking what a user is currently viewing. While rewards and ads maybe opt-in for users, they are not for publishers, leaving us in a very awkward position. If a publisher wants a cut of the rewards, they need to be a part of the Brave Partner program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this behaviour, I feel that Brave is yet another middleman between the user and the advertiser. Other companies also have the same model of running their business. You are trusting an advertising company (Brave) - just like Google - to preserve your privacy. What an irony.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I want the targeted advertisement system to die. I will go to all lengths to block all ads. I feel companies are not entitled to my data or my time (&amp;lsquo;attention&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p>
