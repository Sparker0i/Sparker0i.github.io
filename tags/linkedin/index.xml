&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an even bigger deal for a software developer like me who just started a career almost 1.5 years back. I would have never thought that one of my posts on LinkedIn would ever be trending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it has happened, and here I am putting out my story.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-did-i-perform-on-linkedin-earlier">How did I perform on LinkedIn earlier?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Before May 2020 started, I used to have around 200 connections. Whenever I used to share something on my LinkedIn profile, it would mostly go unnoticed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Views would never cross the double-digit mark. Likes were usually single digit numbers, if not 0. 0 Comments. Period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whereas, the people I was following, had a lot of likes and comments on their posts. When I had a look at their posts, their content was very well structured. Their posts were written as if they were telling a story. Then I realized they used to like and comment on these posts because they were able to relate themselves to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later, when I had a look at my posts on LinkedIn, they never had content. They used to be mostly reshares of someone else&amp;rsquo;s content. You can see a few examples below, along with the view count of that post:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-triggered-a-change">What triggered a change?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Around March 2020, I saw an amazing article on a website which gave a glimpse on the new features coming to Spark 3.0 (You can find that post &lt;a class="link" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/glimpse-into-spark-3-0-early-access-c1854327d6c?ref=localhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>). This time around, while sharing this post on LinkedIn, I decided to put in my thoughts on what I felt about the release of Spark 3. Find this post below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the first time the View count on any of my posts stepped into the triple-figure mark. This was also the first time the Reaction count on my posts touched 5 (the previous best at this point was 3, as shown in the screenshot above).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because there&amp;rsquo;s always a first time for everything ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the time I realized that if I put my thoughts on what I felt about something, I would surely gain more views and likes. I definitely wanted to grow more on LinkedIn and realized that I had to put my content in a better way that people don&amp;rsquo;t find crowded. (That embedded post above had only 1 paragraph which felt cluttered).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-guru">The Guru
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Around a month later, I saw one of my connections, Vaibhav Sisinty commenting on people&amp;rsquo;s posts about his 5-Day LinkedIn workshop. That&amp;rsquo;s not just once. I saw his comments on multiple people&amp;rsquo;s posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While reading the posts, I actually felt that this isn&amp;rsquo;t promotion going on. People are telling their experiences out of the workshop. People were telling the steps they executed and were also showing the results they achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of the workshop was a measly Rs. 500. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge amount where we would have to empty our pockets to grow. I actually contemplated on whether to join his workshop or not a lot. I was in a dilemma because I was just another (inexperienced) software developer on LinkedIn, amongst 1000s of others. I also had other thoughts on my mind - whether this will workshop will help me as a software developer or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I took a leap of faith&amp;hellip; and joined his 5-Day LinkedIn Workshop.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-workshop">The workshop
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I was a part of Batch 3 of his workshop, which ran from 5th-11th May. In short, the content of the workshop was divided into a few parts, each taken over a period of 5 days (actually 6, because he gave one extra day off to complete one of the tasks):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Understanding Target Audience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimizing LinkedIn profile&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Connect with the target audience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create good content&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The content for each of those points in the workshop was well defined. He had recorded sessions for each of those 5 days, and at 9PM he used to have a Live Q&amp;amp;A session of that day&amp;rsquo;s topic. Despite all of the above, execution is key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No Execution, No Results&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of the golden words Vaibhav used to frequently tell inside his videos and the Facebook and WhatsApp groups {Yes, he used to engage with us on WhatsApp as well ;) }. He would also send reminder emails (I guess he sent around 50-70 such mails) to me (and I guess each participant).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-content-boom">The content boom
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ever since the workshop, I posted few contents, whose views and Reaction count were significantly higher than any of my previous posts. Have a look at the two screenshots below:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Views and Reaction count on my posts after executing the contents of the workshop&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least 3x the usual reaction counts and 5-8x views of my posts. I was definitely improving in my LinkedIn game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile views and search appearances were up as well:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Profile views after executing contents of the workshop&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then came the blockbuster. On May 15th 2020 at around 10:15pm, I put up a post on LinkedIn regarding native GPU support for Spark. This was a recent news, and Spark was something I&amp;rsquo;m working on at my workplace. Posting my thoughts on that news definitely made sense. Have a look at that post below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the post where I&amp;rsquo;ve got the best results on inside LinkedIn. Look at the counts below. These numbers are insane for a software developer who had just started out his career:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>View and Reaction count for the above post&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh yes, and the &amp;ldquo;Trending on LinkedIn&amp;rdquo; happened as well, 2.5 days after putting up that post:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.sparker0i.me/journey-10k-post-views-linkedin/661c08335ae500253ce7927e_e79bc1dc-4722-4547-beaf-d7abd0df817d.png"

&lt;p>The Trending part&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Couldn&amp;rsquo;t expect more for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While I did start to see great numbers after executing contents in the workshop, complacency isn&amp;rsquo;t allowed. The workshop contents are supposed to be executed for long (unless LinkedIn detects you are a Super User and stops you from executing for the rest of the day).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vaibhav&amp;rsquo;s workshop is a great place to get started whoever you are - from an entry level Software Developer, to a Digital Marketer, to someone finding the next job - this workshop is for everyone who wants to improve their LinkedIn profile.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Until another post, ciao.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(PS. Not a promotional post. These are definitely my experiences out of this workshop. You can see the results for yourselves)&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
