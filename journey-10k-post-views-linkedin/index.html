Whenever I used to share something on my LinkedIn profile, it would mostly go unnoticed.</p><p>Views would never cross the double-digit mark. Likes were usually single digit numbers, if not 0. 0 Comments. Period.</p><p>Whereas, the people I was following, had a lot of likes and comments on their posts. When I had a look at their posts, their content was very well structured. Their posts were written as if they were telling a story. Then I realized they used to like and comment on these posts because they were able to relate themselves to it.</p><p>Later, when I had a look at my posts on LinkedIn, they never had content. They used to be mostly reshares of someone else&rsquo;s content.

This time around, while sharing this post on LinkedIn, I decided to put in my thoughts on what I felt about the release of Spark 3. Find this post below:</p><p>This was the first time the View count on any of my posts stepped into the triple-figure mark. This was also the first time the Reaction count on my posts touched 5 (the previous best at this point was 3, as shown in the screenshot above).</p><p>Because there&rsquo;s always a first time for everything ;)</p><p>This was the time I realized that if I put my thoughts on what I felt about something, I would surely gain more views and likes. I definitely wanted to grow more on LinkedIn and realized that I had to put my content in a better way that people don&rsquo;t find crowded. (That embedded post above had only 1 paragraph which felt cluttered).</p><h2 id=the-guru>The Guru</h2><p>Around a month later, I saw one of my connections, Vaibhav Sisinty commenting on people&rsquo;s posts about his 5-Day LinkedIn workshop. That&rsquo;s not just once. I saw his comments on multiple people&rsquo;s posts.</p><p>While reading the posts, I actually felt that this isn&rsquo;t promotion going on. People are telling their experiences out of the workshop. People were telling the steps they executed and were also showing the results they achieved.</p><p>The cost of the workshop was a measly Rs. 500. It isn&rsquo;t a huge amount where we would have to empty our pockets to grow. I actually contemplated on whether to join his workshop or not a lot. I was in a dilemma because I was just another (inexperienced) software developer on LinkedIn, amongst 1000s of others. I also had other thoughts on my mind - whether this will workshop will help me as a software developer or not.</p><p>Then I took a leap of faith&mldr; and joined his 5-Day LinkedIn Workshop.</p><h2 id=the-workshop>The workshop</h2><p>I was a part of Batch 3 of his workshop, which ran from 5th-11th May. In short, the content of the workshop was divided into a few parts, each taken over a period of 5 days (actually 6, because he gave one extra day off to complete one of the tasks):</p><ul><li>Understanding Target Audience</li><li>Optimizing LinkedIn profile</li><li>Connect with the target audience</li><li>Create good content</li></ul><p>The content for each of those points in the workshop was well defined. He had recorded sessions for each of those 5 days, and at 9PM he used to have a Live Q&amp;A session of that day&rsquo;s topic. Despite all of the above, execution is key.</p><p>&ldquo;No Execution, No Results&rdquo;.</p><p>This is one of the golden words Vaibhav used to frequently tell inside his videos and the Facebook and WhatsApp groups {Yes, he used to engage with us on WhatsApp as well ;) }. He would also send reminder emails (I guess he sent around 50-70 such mails) to me (and I guess each participant).</p><h2 id=the-content-boom>The content boom</h2><p>Ever since the workshop, I posted few contents, whose views and Reaction count were significantly higher than any of my previous posts.
